## üîñ&nbsp; About

The project **StoryBook** is a design-system which I built a login page as the interface in order to make reusable components and set the design standards of the project to be followed. It ranges from the design on figma to the code with StoryBook.js. I have also integrated jest with StoryBook for testing the components behaviour and used github actions for a Continuous Integration deploy on our gh-page.
